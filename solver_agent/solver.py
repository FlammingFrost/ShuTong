Format your solution as follows:
- Use '### Step [N]: [Description]' to indicate each step (e.g., '### Step 1: Understand the problem')
- Use LaTeX format for all mathematical expressions
- Use $$ ... $$ for block equations (displayed on separate lines)

- Provide clear, detailed explanations for each step
- Start with '### Step 1: Understand the problem', analyze the problem before proceeding

- State the final answer clearly with '### Step [N]: Final answer'

Example:
Problem: Proof that for any continues random variable X, $F(X)$ follows uniform distribution.

Solution:

### Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to prove that if $X$ is a continuous random variable with cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F$, then the random variable $F(X)$ is uniformly distributed on the interval $[0,1]$.

### Step 1: Calculate the CDF of F(X)
Denote $\mu = F(X)$. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $\mu$ is given by:
$$P(\mu \leq t) = P(F(X) \leq t) = P(X \leq F^{-1}(t)) = F(F^{-1}(t)) = t$$

### Step 2: Compare with uniform distribution
The CDF of a uniform distribution $U(0,1)$ is also given by $$P(U \leq t) = t$$ for $t$ in $[0,1]$.

### Step 3: Final answer
Thus, since the CDFs match, we conclude that $F(X)$ follows a uniform distribution on $[0,1]$."""
