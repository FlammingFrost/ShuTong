# UI Updates Summary

## Changes Made to Records Page Display

### New Structure

The Records Page now displays information in a cleaner, more organized way:

#### 1. **Run Summary** (First Section)
- Metrics: Refinement Iterations, Knowledge Points, Max Iterations
- Original Math Problem (with LaTeX support)

#### 2. **Solution Steps with Critiques** (Main Section)
For each step in the solution:
- **Step heading**: "Step N: [Description]"
- **Step content**: Full mathematical content (visible by default)
- **Foldable critique section**: Click to expand and see:
  - Logic correctness (‚úÖ Correct / ‚ùå Incorrect)
  - Logic feedback
  - Calculation correctness (‚úÖ Correct / ‚ùå Incorrect)
  - Calculation feedback
  - Knowledge points identified

This matches the critique schema with fields:
- `step_number`
- `step_description`
- `step_content`
- `is_logically_correct`
- `logic_feedback`
- `is_calculation_correct`
- `calculation_feedback`
- `knowledge_points`

#### 3. **Advanced Details** (Bottom Section)
Two collapsible expanders:

**A. View All Tracked Operations**
- Detailed logs of all operations
- Grouped by operation type
- Shows timestamps, status, and tracked values (simplified view)
- Excludes `*_detail` fields for cleaner display

**B. View Solution Evolution**
- Initial solution with all steps
- Each refinement iteration:
  - Iteration number
  - Feedbacks that triggered the refinement
  - Refined solution steps

### Key Improvements

1. **Step-focused display**: Steps are prominently displayed with content visible, critiques hidden in expanders
2. **No nested expanders**: Avoided Streamlit's limitation by restructuring the layout
3. **LaTeX support**: All mathematical content is properly converted and rendered
4. **Cleaner organization**: Three clear sections (Summary ‚Üí Steps ‚Üí Details)
5. **Better information hierarchy**: Most important info (solution steps) is easily accessible

### Benefits

- **For quick review**: See all solution steps at a glance
- **For detailed analysis**: Expand critiques to see feedback
- **For debugging**: Advanced details section shows all tracked operations
- **For iteration tracking**: Solution evolution shows how refinements improved the solution

## How to Use

1. Go to "Records Page - View History"
2. Select a run from the dropdown
3. View the summary at the top
4. Scroll through solution steps (expand critiques as needed)
5. Optionally expand Advanced Details for:
   - All tracked operations
   - Solution evolution through refinements

The UI is now optimized for reviewing agent-generated solutions with easy access to critiques! üéâ
